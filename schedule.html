We realize many of you may be itching for more astronomy, so we are going to continue a virtual talk series in the mean time.  Our team has been working hard to figure out the logistics of all of this, but we think we can continue to put together talks that you will enjoy, and hopefully by going virtual we can even reach people in a wider community.</p>
                    <p> So please keep an eye out for us on social media and check our schedule for upcoming talks.  These will be posted to our YouTube channel, and while we certainly encourage you to attend the livestreamed event, the videos will continue to remain accessible afterwards for you to watch whenever is convenient!</p>

                this extraordinary astronomical event! Come learn about what happens during an eclipse, the 
                differences between solar and lunar eclipses, how they have influenced various cultures, what 
                role they have played in the history, and how we can safely view it.

                This event will be a little different than what you're used to, with two shorter talks and plenty of

                The James Webb Space Telescope is transforming our knowledge of the earliest stages of galaxy formation. 
                One of the biggest surprises has been the finding that small, young galaxies often contain whoppingly large black 
                holes at their centers. We’ll talk about what a black hole is, how they form, and how we know they 
                exist.  Then we’ll discuss why it’s so surprising to see really big black holes early in the 
                Universe’s history and what it might mean. </p>

                Astronomers use radio telescopes to detect a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is not visible to 
                the human eye. This talk will outline how radio telescopes work, explore the different cosmic 
                phenomena that can be observed with radio telescopes, such as supernova remnants, the gaseous 
                components of galaxies, and pulsars, and how radio astronomy contributes to our understanding 
                of these objects.

            <p> In 2014 Coffeeshop Astrophysics was founded as a small public outreach group aimed at bringing accessbile scientific 
                talks to the Milwaukee community and fostering a love for astrophysics in people of all ages and backgrounds. Now 
                10 years later, we have given over 75 public talks at the Anodyne coffeeshop in Walker's Point and seen dozens of UWM 
                graduate students and postdocs participate. Most importantly we have seen our audience grow to include a mix of long-time 
                attendees as well as many newcomers just discovering our talk series. We are excited to welcome back three past members of Coffeeshop 
                Astrophysics who were integral to its growth and development. They will share with you all the cool work, scientific or otherwise, 
                that they have been up to since leaving UWM.
            <p>
            <p>
                We want to sincerely thank each and every one of you for your support over the past 10 years, and we look forward to 10 more 
                years of sharing science with you and the greater Milwaukee community.
            </p>

            </h4>
            <p> The landscape of astrophysics research and our understanding of the universe has changed 
                dramatically over the past 10 years since the founding of Coffeeshop Astrophysics. Gravitational 
                waves were first discovered in a groundbreaking detection by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational 
                wave Observatory (LIGO). The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, some potentially habitable, 
                helped expand the horizons of planetary science. There were also enormous advancements in space 
                technology and instrumentation such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which in only a couple of 
                years has completely transformed our understanding of the universe both near and far. In this talk 
                we will review the exciting discoveries and scientific improvements of the last decade and talk 
                about what we hope to accomplish in the next ten years!
