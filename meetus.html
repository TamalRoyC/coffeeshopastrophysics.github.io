                                    to take and analyze data on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. My hobbies

                                    work since my childhood. In high school, I was more attracted to physics over other
                                    sciences because it dealt with the simplest systems and yet it can be very powerful.
                                    Just after I joined an undergraduate program in physics in India, the news of the
                                    first gravitational wave being detected broke out. The fact that we can detect
                                    something so tiny fascinated me and started digging into it. This brought me to the
                                    graduate program in University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and have been currently on
                                    gravitational wave cosmology. In my spare time I like to experiment with cooking, go
                                    on walks, watch cricket, or think about random things! &rdquo;</p>

                                    explaining the discovery of the first exoplanets that changed my life. Since that
                                    day, my interest in investigating the mysteries of the universe has been a
                                    companion. During my teenage years, I read all the books and information about
                                    astronomy I could find. And was this love for the skies that led me to a bachelor's
                                    in Aerospace engineering, and to later pursue a Ph.D. in physics at UWM. I joined
                                    Coffeeshop Astro because I wanted to motivate others to love and (maybe) work with
                                    science in the same way I was inspired by that first article. Outside of my work, I
                                    enjoy reading romances, writing and traveling.&rdquo;</p>

                                    intriguing. But my genuine interest in Astronomy sparked as an 11-year-old when I
                                    was gifted an encyclopedia on space. Going through it, I realized there is more to
                                    the night sky than just the dots of light that we see. Growing up I started to take
                                    an interest in Physics to know how things work. Hence, I pursued a bachelor's and a
                                    master's in Physics and decided to continue into research. I joined the graduate
                                    program at UWM in 2022 and my research interest is gravitational wave astronomy.
                                    Back when I was in school, I used to enjoy explaining to my friends' the new things
                                    I read from different books on space. That stopped happening as I grew up. But maybe
                                    some part of me wants to do it again, hence I decided to join the Coffeeshop
                                    Astrophysics group. I like reading books and watching soccer in my spare time, and

Alex McEwen

Growing up in a small Appalachian town in western Maryland, I spent many nights outside with my brothers listening to dad name all of the constellations. As I grew older, I developed an interest in understanding things - and the more I understood, the more I realized there was to learn! I started my astronomy career partway through an engineering internship when I was given a telescope for my birthday and decided to change my major to physics. I started studying pulsars - neutron stars that rotate at incredible rates and emit radio waves - as soon as I returned to school, and I haven't stopped yet. Outside of school/work life, I spend a lot of my time making music, woodworking, biking, swimming, and camping.
                    
Ian Brown
                    
I have been interested in science for as long as I can remember. I grew up outside of a town with a population of about 500 people so I always had great views of the stars on clear nights. I was also lucky enough to have parents who encouraged my curiosity and showed me the stars and constellations. I naturally became curious and wanted to know about what I saw. I decided to make a career out of my curiosity and came to UWM in 2016 where I have been researching fast radio bursts. When time permits, I still like to go camping out away from the city lights to see a meteor shower or just admire the beautiful complexity of the cosmos.

Allie Spaulding

Growing up in small city gave me the opportunity to look up and see tons of stars any night that I wanted to. That fascination in exploring the universe led me to pursue a Physics degree at Loyola University Chicago. I knew I wanted to continue my Physics career as a graduate student, specifically focusing on astrophysics which is why I ended up at UWM. I am pursuing my PhD with my research focusing on simulating and analyzing different astrophysical phenomena such as tidal disruption events, disk dynamics and various other aspects of theoretical astrophysics. I love that even though we might not be able to actually see everything that’s going on in the universe, we have enough tools and technology to simulate and study so much of it. Outside of school, I like to read, travel, play volleyball and spend time with my family and friends.

I was 'hooked on' astronomy when as a school kid I made my first telescope and looked at the moon. I was amazed at the amount of detail I could see, albeit it was a basic telescope. But this left me wanting for more; to know about things further away - the planets, stars and galaxies! My academic endeavor, ever since, has therefore been in the domain of astrophysics. I completed my undergraduate education from my home country of India and came to UWM as a doctoral student in 2016.  My research is focused within the exciting new field of gravitational-wave astronomy which has opened a new window of observing the universe, helping us know about exotic, mysterious objects such as black holes and neutron stars. In my spare time apart from research, I love to play and watch cricket, cook and travel.

Casey McGrath

One day in fifth grade my teacher began a lesson on the stars and planets, and I was hooked - for me, that lesson has not yet ended!   This quest of science has been a grand adventure which has taken me from the observatories on the volcanoes of Hawaii to the underground particle smasher outside of Geneva, and has afforded me the chance to meet a great number of fascinating people, studying incredible things.  Now as I pursue my own advanced studies as a graduate student in gravitational waves and pulsars, I hope to unravel a few mysteries, and unearth even more.  But aside from these pursuits I enjoy running and biking, cooking, driving my motorcycle, and exploring new places when I get the chance.

Joseph Swiggum

I am a radio astronomer and postdoc at UW-Milwaukee, unraveling the mysteries of the pulsar universe. I spend most of my time searching for new pulsars and “timing” them to learn as much as I can about individual sources as well as the underlying population. I apply these efforts towards improving the NANOGrav collaboration’s pulsar timing array, a galactic-scale gravitational wave detector. Outside work, I play and watch lots of volleyball and enjoy cooking, geocaching and board games.

Angela Van Sistine

I am originally from the greater Milwaukee area (Waterford) and am excited to be back home in Wisconsin.  I studied physics and astrophysics at UW-Madison and received my PhD from Indiana University in Bloomington, IN.   At UWM, I am doing research on star-forming galaxies in the nearby universe.  These types of galaxies are interesting because they can tell us about how galaxies grow and change over time.  Also, the nearby star-forming galaxies I look at can host the types of gravitational wave events that can be detected by LIGO, which many of my colleagues work on-check out some of the other bios on this page.  When I'm not working with galaxies, I enjoy running, skiing and snowboarding, camping, brewing beer, and spending time with my family.

Shaon Ghosh

I am a gravitational wave astrophysicist, trained in extracting science from, cataclysmic astrophysical events like colliding neutron stars and merging black holes. I got drawn into this field due to my love for astrophysics, which is the study of the cosmos and general relativity, the study of the spacetime itself. After completing my Ph.D. in 2013 from the Washington State University, I worked for three years with astronomers to combine this field with the traditional observational astronomy. Currently, at the UWM I am working as a member of the LIGO scientific collaboration in some of the most ambitious projects that we can now realistically think of achieving due to vast improvement in technology, like studying the matter of the neutron star and conducting gravitational wave astronomy using the LIGO detectors. Outside work I like reading books, especially science fiction, playing RTS computer games and spending time with my family.

Kristina Islo

I was not a science-minded child — my experiments started and ended with Doctor Dreadful’s candy laboratory; but, upon entering UWM as a freshman, I had an amazing teacher show me how science only requires you be curious, tenacious in solving problems, and open to the solutions. Since then I’ve become a graduate student, aiming to get my PhD in Gravitational Wave Astrophysics. In addition to my research, I’m involved in outreach efforts such as this to encourage diversity in the scientific community. When not working, you can find me reading all sorts of books, annoying my cat, napping, or looking up. 

Sarah Vigeland

I came to UWM as a postdoc in 2015. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Carleton College in Minnesota and a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research interests include gravitation, black holes, and neutron stars. I am part of the NANOGrav collaboration, which uses pulsars to detect low-frequency gravitational waves from supermassive black holes in other galaxies. When I’m not doing physics, I enjoy reading, knitting, running, and playing computer games.

Shasvath Kapadia

I joined UWM as a postdoctoral researcher in the summer of 2016 to participate in a multinational collaborative endeavor (LIGO) to hunt for gravitational waves – ripples in the very fabric of spacetime that are incredibly difficult to detect. Nevertheless, their recent discovery has opened a new window to our Universe, allowing us to “see” the orbits of black holes, and possibly other exotic objects, lurking in distant regions of the cosmos. I feel lucky to be a part of this worldwide effort at such an exciting time! Apart from research, I like listening to music and attending group exercise sessions at the university. Having grown up close to the ocean in a coastal town in southern India, I love the fact that Milwaukee is next to a large body of water, which is why I enjoy taking walks by Lake Michigan – when the weather’s not too cold.

Hong Qi

I am a graduate student studying gravitational wave astrophysics at UWM. As part of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, I do gravitational-wave data analysis and collaborate within the LIGO team to do astrophysics such as measuring the Hubble constant with both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves. My interest in astronomy started when I was about 5 years old and I am very glad that I have been exploring and studying some aspects of it. In my spare time I like reading sci-fi, learning languages (Latin, Cantonese, Japanese, French, etc), teaching children and teenagers Math Olympiads, and doing light sports like ping-pong.

Debnandini Mukherjee

I joined UWM in 2012, to get my PhD in physics. Before that, I completed my masters and bachelors degree from University of Delhi, India. I presently work with LIGO, a collaboration that works on gravitational wave cosmology. We are trying to detect, measure and study ripples in spacetime, coming from distant stars and black holes that spin around each other, as they would tell us new things about our universe. Coming from an ancient culture, that has been doing science and math for a few thousand years (including the discovery of zero), I was exposed to physics pretty early in life. What excites me most about physics, is its ability to transform the mundane into a world of questions and fascination. To think that you, me and everything around us is all a part of a fabric like object called spacetime, that bends around very heavy masses, blows my mind. My other interests include literature, reading and writing poems and novels. I also do some weekend painting and sketching.

Danielle Berg

I am a postdoc at UW-Milwaukee, working with Dawn Erb on high-redshift, gravitationally-lensed galaxies.  My expertise is in using ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared light to study the chemical signature of star-forming regions in other galaxies.  In my free time, I love to try new foods, travel, and teach spin class!

Sarah Caudill

Hi! I'm a researcher at UWM working with the LIGO collaboration to detect gravitational waves. For the first time last fall, we observed waves from the collision of very large black holes. I'm looking forward to analyzing more LIGO data to uncover the physics of extreme astrophysical events. In my free time, I love cooking, exercising, and gardening...and looking for Pok&eacutemon.&rdquo;</p>

Sydney Chamberlin

I'm Sydney. I grew up out West in the Rocky Mountains and moved to Milwaukee 5 years ago to study astrophysics in grad school. I work on efforts to detect something called gravitational waves, which are tiny ripples in the universe produced by merging black holes, dead-star remnants, supernovae explosions, and other cool astrophysical objects. These ripples are hitting us all the time, but they are very small and hard to detect! When I'm not doing science, I like to be outdoors. I love camping, hiking, biking, triathlons, and spending time with my dog.

Megan DeCesar

I’m Megan.  I study pulsars — tiny, dense objects that spin very fast, up to 1000 times per second (think kitchen blender).  Pulsars are left behind when a massive star explodes in a supernova.  They emit light from a small patch on their surface, and as they spin, they appear to pulse, just like a lighthouse.  Pulsars are strange, exotic objects, and by studying them we can learn a lot about physics in extreme environments that we can’t probe here on Earth.  When I’m not thinking about pulsars, I like to read, play violin, ride horses, and spend time with pets.

Laura Nuttall

I moved to the states about a year ago to carry on my research as part of the <a href='http://www.ligo.org/'>LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a>; I'm originally from the UK. Most of my days are spent thinking about how to detect gravitational waves. When two extreme objects collide (such as black holes and or neutron stars) they will produce ripples in space time which can tell us a lot of never before known information about the physics which is taking place in these extreme systems. When I actually dare to leave my office I enjoy running around beautiful (not frozen) Milwaukee and exploring this part of the world.

Laleh Sadeghian

I'm Laleh. I'm from Tehran, Iran. I started to study physics in University of Tehran and after getting my master degree, I came to United States in 2009 to continue my research. I got my PhD from Washington University in St. Louis working on the super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way and also Dark Matter, the mysterious invisible content of our universe which constitutes more than eighty percent of the total matter in the universe. Recently I’ve started to do research in Gravitational Wave detection and besides studying all of these interesting phenomena, the joy of my life come from watching movies, reading and doing workouts like yoga and boxing.
    
Alex Urban

I'm just a plucky graduate student at the CGCA, and in my spare time, a sci-fi aficionado and intellectual-in-training. My research focuses on cacophonous explosions called gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which we see on Earth from across the universe -- billions of light-years away in space and countless eons ago in time. These outbursts are so fleeting, and so powerful, that in a pithy way I like to think of them as the best bangs since the Big one. They are continually blowing my infantile simian mind.... and making that statement puts me in a state of joy and whimsy that is borderline irresponsible.
